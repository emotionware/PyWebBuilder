# PyWebBuilder

### Introduction

PyWebBuilder is an open source project for developing enterprise-data web projects of any kind.

It uses MySQL as database or MariaDB.
Automatically creates source code integrated on one Python Projects, a Flask project.

Runs on Linux and Windows, i suppose on Mac too, i have nost tested (i dont have a Mac).

It works better with Google Chrome.

What kind of projects you can develop?
Database driven apps like...
CRM, ERP of any kind, administrative solucionts, account solutions, data control projects of any kind; customers, products, etc. 

I developed with and abstraction idea of data model applications.

Everything here data related has two main web forms; 

- the datagrid view
- the form view

With the datagrid view you can admin multiple records, delete, open, block, find data over the records etc..
With the form view you can edit one record and do any actions related to that record.

#Speed is the point
I developed this solution for making developer life easier. As a developer when i need to create a solution usually the process it's very similar. Providers, customers, productos, sells, discounts... records... tables... querys... reports... Usually all lands at same technical solutions.... So, can we automate all this?... this is the point with PyWelBuilder.
